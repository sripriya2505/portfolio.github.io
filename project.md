# **PROBLEM DEFINITION**

Introduction The selected project focuses on the design and development of a restaurant management system, a crucial domain in the hospitality industry. A restaurant management system integrates various aspects of restaurant operations, including order management, inventory tracking, billing, and customer service. Efficient management of these areas is essential for ensuring smooth restaurant operations and improving customer satisfaction. The project was selected after reviewing a relevant white paper on modern restaurant management systems, which explored the challenges and solutions in automating and optimizing restaurant processes. The white paper discussed the increasing demand for digital solutions in the restaurant industry and how software systems can streamline tasks such as order taking, kitchen management, and payment processing. Drawing inspiration from the findings in the paper, the project aims to design a system that enhances operational efficiency, reduces human error, and provides an improved customer experience through features such as real-time order tracking and automated billing. The system also aims to address inventory management challenges by integrating real-time data to track stock levels and order supplies. This project serves as an essential step in understanding the role of technology in the restaurant industry and contributes to ongoing research in developing smarter, more efficient solutions for hospitality businesses.

Problem Statement Domain The problem being addressed in this project is the inefficiency and manual errors that occur in traditional restaurant management. Restaurants often struggle with order tracking, inventory management, and billing, leading to delays, inaccuracies, and poor customer experiences. This project aims to automate these processes through a comprehensive restaurant management system that integrates order management, real-time inventory tracking, and automated billing, improving operational efficiency.

The need for this system was identified from a white paper on modern restaurant management systems, which emphasized the challenges faced by restaurants in managing high-volume operations manually. The paper highlighted how automation can reduce human error, speed up service, and enhance customer satisfaction. Motivated by the need to improve restaurant operations, the project was selected to provide a solution that streamlines daily tasks, allowing restaurant staff to focus on quality service while minimizing errors and inefficiencies.

Module Description In this project, the focus is on developing and automating the Order Management and Billing System modules for the restaurant management system. The Order Management module is designed to streamline the process of taking, tracking, and processing customer orders. It allows waitstaff to input orders into the system, which are then transmitted directly to the kitchen for preparation. This minimizes the chances of manual errors, reduces the time taken for orders to be relayed, and ensures that kitchen staff have real-time access to customer requests. The module also tracks the status of orders, from being received to being served, and provides timely updates to customers.

The Billing System is integrated with the order management module, ensuring that customers are billed accurately and promptly based on their order history. It automates the process of generating bills, applying discounts, and calculating totals, removing the need for manual calculations and minimizing the risk of billing errors. The system also supports various payment methods, providing flexibility for customers.

By focusing on these modules, the project aims to improve operational efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance customer satisfaction by providing faster and more accurate service. These modules are essential for optimizing the overall restaurant management process.

Key Features: Customer Queue: Allows adding and removing customers from a queue. Reservations: Allows table reservations and releases them when necessary. Inventory: Manage stock of items. Food Menu and Billing: Displays the menu, takes customer orders, and generates bills. Delivery System: Calculates the shortest distance between locations. Lodging: Manages available rooms and bookings for customers. The program is designed to be a management system for a restaurant with functionalities for customer management, inventory management, reservations, food menu, and more.














# **Explanation of the Room Booking System in our course project**

# Data Structure Used:

A set is used to store the available rooms. The reason for using a set is that it automatically sorts the rooms by their room ID, and it ensures that no duplicate rooms exist.

Each element in the set is a pair consisting of:
A unique room ID (integer) that identifies the room.
A room type (string) that indicates the category of the room, such as "Single", "Double", or "Suite".
Booking a Room:

When a user wants to book a room, the system checks if the requested room (based on its ID and type) exists in the set of available rooms.
If the room is found, the system removes the room from the set, which effectively "books" the room and makes it unavailable for other users.
A confirmation message is shown to the user that the room has been successfully booked.
If the room is not available (either it was already booked or doesn't exist), the system informs the user that the room is unavailable.
Key Operations:

Search for Room: The system looks for a room by matching both the room ID and the room type.
Remove Room: When a room is successfully booked, it is removed from the set of available rooms.
Error Handling: If the room isn't found (i.e., it’s already booked or doesn't exist), the system displays an error message.
Why Use a Set:

#  QUICK Sorting:

The set ensures that rooms are always sorted by their room ID, which helps with efficient searching and management.
Uniqueness: A set automatically eliminates any duplicate entries, ensuring that a room cannot be booked more than once unless explicitly removed.
Efficient Operations: Searching, inserting, and removing rooms from the set all take logarithmic time, making the system efficient even as the number of rooms increases.
In essence, the room booking system works by maintaining a set of available rooms, and when a user books a room, the system checks availability and removes the room from the set if it’s booked successfully. If not, the system notifies the user of the unavailability.

# Summary of Key Data Structures:

List/Array: Used to store sequences of items (e.g., orders, inventory).

Dictionary (Hash Map): Used for fast lookups of menu items, inventory, and reservations.

Queue: Ensures orders are processed in the order they were placed (FIFO).

Heap/Priority Queue: Optionally used for prioritizing low-stock items in inventory.

Set: Ensures uniqueness, especially for reporting purposes.

Tuple/NamedTuple: Can be used to store structured data (e.g., order details, reservation information).

# Summary of Algorithms:

Search Algorithms: Fast lookup for menu items, inventory, and reservations using dictionary key searches.

Update Algorithms: For modifying quantities in inventory or changing prices/availability of items.

Comparison Algorithms: To verify sufficient payment during order confirmation.

FIFO (First In, First Out): For managing order fulfillment (i.e., processing orders in the order they are received).

Sorting Algorithms: Used for ranking items based on their sales or popularity for analytics.

Simple Iteration: Used in various functions to traverse lists (e.g., orders, inventory, menu).

**Efficiency and Complexity:**
Time Complexity: Many operations (e.g., searching an item in a dictionary, updating inventory) typically take O(1), making the system efficient.
Space Complexity: The space complexity depends on the number of orders, inventory items, and reservations stored in dictionaries and lists.

# **Customer Queue Management:**
The Customer Queue Management system ensures that customers are served in the order they arrive. It uses a queue data structure where customers are added to the queue as they arrive and removed in the same order (FIFO - First In, First Out) when they are served. This helps ensure a fair and efficient process for handling customers.

The primary algorithm used here is the FIFO (First In, First Out) algorithm, which ensures that customers are served in the order they joined the queue. This approach is simple but effective, ensuring that no customer is skipped or kept waiting unnecessarily.
